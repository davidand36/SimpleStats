The Contingency Table test analyzes the relation between two categorical variables. Each variable has a small number of possible values and the table contains the counts, i.e. the observed frequency of each combination of values of the variables.

Enter the number of rows and columns and the table sample data. The numbers can be separated by pretty much anything: newlines, spaces, punctuation, or even text. Then click Analyze.

The χ² (Chi-square) test tests the hypothesis that the two variables are independent.

For a 2x2 table the test is one-tailed (because the “direction” of the relation can be inferred from the data). (The probability for a two-tailed test would be twice that reported.) In addition a Fisher's “exact” test is presented. (If the sample size is large an equivalent  χ² test with Yate's correction is used.) This test is most appropriate when the margins (row and column totals) are considered fixed, but may be too conservative otherwise.
