The Correlation test analyzes a random sample of pairs of real numbers representing two variables (which are referred to as X and Y) from a population with an approximately bivariate normal distribution.

Enter the sample data however you want. The numbers can be separated by pretty much anything: newlines, spaces, punctuation, or even text. Then select the hypothesized relation and click Analyze.

Sample statistics computed are: mean (average), and standard deviation (the square root of the unbiased variance estimate) for each variable, and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), a measure of the linear dependence of the variables.

The t test tests an hypothesis about the correlation, ρ, namely whether it is less than (or greater than or simply not equal to) zero.

The linear regression estimates the coefficients of the equation Y = α + ßX + ε (where ε is a residual “error” term with a mean of zero) that best fit the data. Both the mean and standard deviation of the estimated coefficients are given as well as the standard deviation of the residual.
